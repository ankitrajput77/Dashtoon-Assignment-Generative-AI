# Dashtoon-Assignment-Generative-AI

## Aim 
The aim of this assignment is to create a deep learning model capable of adapting an existing work to resemble the aesthetic of any art. The model should be able to analyze the artistic style of the selected art and apply similar stylistic features to a new, original artwork, creating a piece that seems as though it could have been created by the artist themselves.
